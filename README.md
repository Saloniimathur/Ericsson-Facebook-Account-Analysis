This project involves web scraping Ericsson's Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ericsson/?brand_redir=290266184368865) using the facebook_scraper module in Python. The collected data is then subjected to sentiment analysis using the vaderSentiment module to classify the posts as positive, negative, or neutral. The scraped data is then stored in an Excel file for further analysis.

## Introduction
Social media plays a vital role in understanding customer sentiment and engagement. In this project, we analyze Ericsson's Facebook page to gain insights into the performance of their posts and understand how customers are interacting with the content.

## Data Collection
Using the facebook_scraper module, we scraped Ericsson's Facebook page to retrieve information such as post text, number of likes, comments, and shares, and the post timestamp. The data collection process allowed us to obtain a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis
To better understand the sentiment of the posts, we performed sentiment analysis using the vaderSentiment module. This allowed us to classify the posts into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on their content.

## Data Analysis with Tableau
After data collection and sentiment analysis, we stored the scraped data in an Excel file for easy accessibility. Subsequently, we utilized Tableau for in-depth data analysis and visualization. Tableau's powerful features allowed us to create interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Visualizations and Insights
The visualizations derived from Tableau provided us with valuable insights, including:

1. Maximum number of posts in February 2023 (25 posts) indicating high activity during that period.
